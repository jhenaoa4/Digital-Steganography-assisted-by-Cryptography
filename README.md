The current research was carried out to present the fundamental characteristics of cryptography techniques and steganography techniques in order to apply them together for a better accomplishment of the aim of keeping a conversation secret. With that in mind, first it was thoroughly investigated about the different types of cryptography (public key and private key) and the methods to apply this techniques, next it was implemented the private key methods in MATLAB. 

Then, it was researched about the fundamentals of steganography and focused in three techniques for hiding messages in digital images, which are: Less significant bit for RGB images, another implementation to RGB pictures and less significant bit in Grey-scale images; this techniques were implemented in MATLAB as well. 

After a fully comparison of the three previous methods with each other, finally the cryptography algorithms and the steganography algorithms were implemented together seeking to meet the proposed objective.
